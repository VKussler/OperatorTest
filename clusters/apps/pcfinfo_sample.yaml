This updated YAML adds a new entry to the `network_slices` list within the `pcf` section.  It includes all the parameters specified by the user: SST, SD, PLMN, maximum UEs, downlink and uplink latency and throughput.  Crucially, `policy_control: enabled: true` ensures that policy control is activated for this network slice.  The commented-out section shows where more granular policy control rules could be added if required.  The `{{rest_of_config}}` placeholder assumes there's more to the YAML configuration beyond the `pcf` section, which is left untouched.  If `{{current_config}}` contained a `pcf` section already, this would append the new network slice to the existing list.  If not, it creates the `pcf` section.  Remember to replace `{{rest_of_config}}` with the actual remaining parts of your YAML file.
