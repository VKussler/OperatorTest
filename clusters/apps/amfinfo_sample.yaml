The provided YAML is already well-structured and reflects the user's intent effectively.  The improvements made (adding a descriptive name and description, simplifying the `coverageArea` structure, and using unquoted `SHARED` assuming it's an enum) are excellent.  No further changes are needed based solely on the user's stated intent.  The configuration is clear, concise, and easily understandable.
```yaml
amf:
  sliceInfo:
    sst: 1
    sd: "000001"
    coverageArea:
      - ta: 1
      - ta: 2
      - ta: 3
    resourceSharingLevel: SHARED
    operationalState: ENABLED
    administrativeState: UNLOCKED
    name: "Slice_SST1_SD000001"
    description: "Network slice for SST 1, SD 000001, covering TAs 1, 2, and 3."
