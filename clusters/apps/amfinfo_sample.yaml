You did not provide a YAML configuration to update.  To answer your question, assuming a YAML structure like this:

```yaml
amf:
  sliceInfo:
    sst: null
    sd: null
    coverageArea: []
    resourceSharingLevel: null
```

The updated YAML based on the user's intent would be:

```yaml
amf:
  sliceInfo:
    sst: 1
    sd: "000001"
    coverageArea: [1, 2, 3]
    resourceSharingLevel: "SHARED"
