The provided YAML already includes a `sliceInfo` section.  However, it's currently structured as a list of individual attributes, which is not ideal for representing a single slice.  A more organized approach would be to use a list of dictionaries, each representing a slice.  This allows for multiple slices to be configured.

Here's the updated YAML reflecting this improvement and incorporating the user's intent:

```yaml
# Sample AMF NRM Instance
pLMNInfoList:
  - pLMNId:
      mcc: "208"
      mnc: "93"
aMFIdentifier: "amf-1.example.com"
sBIFQDN: "amf-1.sbi.example.com"
cNSIIdList: ["slice-1-cn"]
managedNFProfile:
  nfInstanceId: "amf-instance-001"
  nfType: "AMF"
  heartBeatTimer: 60
  hostAddr: "192.168.1.10"
amfInfo:
  aMFRegionId: "1"
  aMFSetId: 100
  gUAMIdList:
    - pLMNId:
        mcc: "208"
        mnc: "93"
      aMFIdentifier: "amf-1.example.com"
aMFSetRef: "/AMFSet/set-1" 
sliceInfo:
  - sST: 1
    sD: "000001"
    tACList: [1, 2, 3]
    resourceSharingLevel: "SHARED"
```

This version uses a list containing a single dictionary for the slice information, making the structure clearer and more easily extensible to support multiple network slices.  Each key-value pair within the dictionary represents a slice attribute.
