Please provide the `{{current_config}}` YAML.  I need the existing YAML to update it based on the "create-slice" intent.  I need to know what kind of slice the user wants to create (e.g., a database slice, a network slice, a software slice, etc.) and what parameters are relevant.  Without the current configuration, I can only offer a generic example.

For example, if the current config is about network slices and the user wants to create a new one, a possible updated config might look like this:

```yaml
slices:
  - name: new_slice
    type: network
    vnf:
      - name: vnf1
        image: vnf1-image
        resources:
          cpu: 2
          memory: 4GB
  - name: existing_slice #... existing slices remain unchanged
    type: network
    vnf:
      - name: vnf2
        image: vnf2-image
        resources:
          cpu: 1
          memory: 2GB
```

Provide your `{{current_config}}` so I can give you a more accurate and helpful response.
