The improved YAML is a good step towards a more robust configuration. Here's a further refined version with additional improvements focusing on data types, validation potential, and extensibility:

```yaml
amf:
  sliceInfo:
    sst: 1
    sd: "000001"
    coverageArea:
      - ta: 1
      - ta: 2
      - ta: 3
    resourceSharingLevel: SHARED
    name: "Slice_SST1_SD000001"
    description: "Network slice with TAs 1, 2, and 3"
    operationalState: ENABLED
    administrativeState: UNLOCKED
    # Add more optional fields for future extensibility:
    qosParameters: # Example of a complex nested structure
      priorityLevel: 1
      guaranteedBitrate: 1000000 # bits per second
    additionalParameters: {} #Allows for adding vendor specific parameters or future extensions

```

**Further Improvements:**

* **Explicit Data Types (Implicit):**  While YAML is flexible, explicitly structuring the data helps with clarity and potential automated validation.  For example, using `ta: 1` instead of just `1` clarifies that these are Tracking Areas.  This also allows for easier parsing and validation in a program.  The `SHARED` value is also improved by removing the quotes, as it is likely an enum.

* **Operational and Administrative States:** Explicitly adding `operationalState` and `administrativeState` fields with defined values (ENABLED/DISABLED, LOCKED/UNLOCKED) improves clarity and allows for better control and monitoring.  These should ideally be enums in a real-world implementation.

* **Nested Structures:** The addition of `qosParameters` demonstrates how to handle more complex configuration options. This allows for flexible extension without modifying the base structure.

* **`additionalParameters` Field:** This is a crucial addition for future-proofing. It allows for adding vendor-specific parameters or other extensions without breaking the core structure.  This field could be a dictionary or map.

* **Data Validation (Implicit):**  A robust system would validate the input data. For example, it should check if `sst` and `sd` are within valid ranges, if `resourceSharingLevel` is a valid option (e.g., from an enum), and that `coverageArea` contains only valid TAs.  This is still implicitly assumed in this example, but crucial for a production system.


This enhanced YAML provides a more structured, maintainable, and extensible configuration, better suited for real-world deployment and management.  Remember that proper data validation and error handling are essential in a production environment.
